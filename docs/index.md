# Pulsar Processing: MeerKAT documentation

The following is documentation on how to process MeerKat pulsar observations, primarily on OzSTAR.

If you have a problem feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/OZGrav/meerkat_pulsar_docs/issues)
on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/OZGrav/meerkat_pulsar_docs)
or make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks),
make the changes yourself and make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
so we can implement them.
